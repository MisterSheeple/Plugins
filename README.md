Plugins written for Not Awesome 2

## writefont.cs
This plugin was originally (and graciously) written by UnknownShadow200 for Not Awesome 2.
In order for it to function, you must create the folder "extra/fonts" and place a font .png file inside. These font files are arranged like the ones that the client texture pack uses.
An example font (the font used in the webclient) has been provided in the writefont folder.
