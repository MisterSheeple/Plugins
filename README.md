Plugins written for Not Awesome 2

## writefont.cs
This plugin was originally (and graciously) written by UnknownShadow200 for Not Awesome 2.
In order for it to function, you must create the folder "extra/fonts" and place a font .png file inside. These font files are arranged like the ones that the client texture pack uses.
An example font (the font used in the webclient) has been provided in the writefont folder. See /help writefont for in-game usage.

## cefcontainment.cs
This plugin makes it so that only players who have permission to build in the map may use [cef](https://github.com/SpiralP/classicube-cef-loader-plugin) commands.

## grc.cs
This plugin adds /GotoRandomCool, which is like /gotorandom, but based on a curated list. The list can be managed with the /grc command.

## make.cs
This plugins adds /make and /makeGB, which allows you to quickly create shapes such as slabs, walls, and stairs, for the level you're in or the entire server.

Use `/help make` or `/help makegb` for more information.

## orderblocks.cs
This plugin makes ordering the block menu much easier. See `/help orderblocks` for usage. The top left of the inventory matches with 0, 0, 0 in the blockorder world. All blocks should have 1 block of air between them.

## tempbot.cs
This plugin is complimentary to [Not-Awesome-Script](https://github.com/NotAwesome2/Not-Awesome-Script). It allows you to create clientside instances of bots to manipulate with scripted movements. See /help tempbot for more details.

This plugin also comes with bonus /flipcoin and /movebots commands. See their /help for more info.

## ipnick.cs
This plugin introduces an "IP nickname" to players, which allows anyone to identify accounts by IP without seeing the actual IP address.

It is displayed in /whois and when the player logs in.

## nasgen.cs
This plugin adds [Not-Awesome-Survival](https://github.com/NotAwesome2/Nas) style gen as a /newlvl gen option.
